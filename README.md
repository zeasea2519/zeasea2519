- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @zeasea2519.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming and always have been - I wrote my first code when I was 8!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning with The Odin Project - after the 'Foundations' course I plan to take the JavaScript route.
- ðŸ“« I've had experience with (but am not necessarily expert in) batch scripts, HTML, CSS and Python.
      I learnt them in that order. When I was 8 I made my own batch scripts, a fake virus (obviously) and several dodgy-looking HTML pages. It all went uphill from there.
- ðŸ“ª You can reach me on zea.sea@yahoo.com - I don't share any other social media publicly. Note that this is not my personal email, so I may not see your message immediately.
